This surface skimmer is no new technology, however, we seek to add a few improvements that would allow us to have a better product.

# Detailed Water Surface Cleaning Robot Brief

## 1. Hull Design and Dimensions
- Type: Catamaran-style hull
  - Provides excellent stability in various water conditions
  - Dual-hull design reduces water resistance and improves efficiency
  - Allows for a wider platform, increasing the effective cleaning area
- Dimensions: 2.5m x 1.5m x 0.75m (overall robot size)
  - Compact enough for easy transportation and deployment
  - Large enough to house all necessary components and collect a significant amount of debris
  - Low profile (0.75m height) minimizes wind resistance and improves stability

## 2. Garbage Collection System
- Method: Surface skimming conveyor belt with hooks
  - Conveyor belt efficiently moves debris from the water surface into the collection area
  - Hooks on the conveyor belt help capture and retain various types of floating debris
  - Continuous operation allows for non-stop cleaning while the robot is in motion
- Mesh size: 5mm x 5mm
  - Fine mesh ensures capture of small plastic particles and microplastics
  - Balances thorough cleaning with maintaining water flow through the system
- Additional feature: Combine harvester-type mechanism
  - Chops collected garbage into smaller pieces
  - Increases storage capacity by reducing the volume of collected debris
  - Facilitates easier processing and disposal of collected waste
- Capacity: 25kg
  - Substantial collection capacity for extended operation without the need for frequent emptying
  - Weight is centrally located to maintain optimal balance and stability

## 3. Structural Layout
- Electronics: Located at the back of the machine
  - Keeps sensitive components away from the wet collection area
  - Allows for easy access for maintenance and upgrades
  - Provides natural cooling from the rear airflow during movement
- Garbage collection: Centrally positioned
  - Optimizes the Center of Gravity (COG) as the collection bin fills
  - Ensures stable operation throughout the cleaning process
  - Allows for efficient transfer of debris from the conveyor belt
- Batteries: Distributed on the front of the hull
  - Creates a slight front tilt for improved water intake into the collection system
  - Serves as ballast to counterbalance the collected garbage
  - Helps maintain optimal trim and stability during operation

## 4. Propulsion and Steering
- Motors: 12V BLDC (Brushless DC) motors
  - High efficiency for extended battery life
  - Low maintenance requirements for reduced operational costs
  - Quiet operation to minimize disturbance in aquatic environments
- Configuration:
  - Two motors at the rear for forward and reverse propulsion
    - Provides powerful, efficient movement through water
    - Allows for precise speed control and maneuverability
  - Two motors on the left and right for steering
    - Enables tight turning radius for navigating in confined spaces
    - Allows for sideways movement and precise positioning
- Additional stability: Reaction wheel system
  - Actively counteracts wave motion in choppy waters
  - Improves cleaning efficiency by maintaining a stable platform
  - Enhances the robot's ability to operate in diverse weather conditions

## 5. Navigation System
- Primary method: GPS with waypoint-based path planning
  - Allows for autonomous operation over large areas
  - Enables the creation of efficient cleaning patterns
  - Facilitates return-to-base functionality for recharging or emptying
- Future enhancement: Computer vision-based system
  - Will enable real-time detection and targeting of debris concentrations
  - Can improve cleaning efficiency by focusing on areas with the most pollution
  - Potential for obstacle avoidance and improved navigation in complex environments
  - Implementation pending availability of suitable training datasets

## 6. Key Features
- Efficient garbage collection and processing
  - Combination of conveyor belt, fine mesh, and chopping mechanism maximizes cleaning effectiveness
- Stable operation in various water conditions
  - Catamaran hull and reaction wheel system ensure functionality in different environments
- Balanced weight distribution for optimal performance
  - Thoughtful placement of components maintains stability as garbage is collected
- Eco-friendly electric propulsion
  - Zero emissions during operation, minimizing environmental impact
- Autonomous navigation capabilities
  - Reduces human intervention and allows for continuous, efficient cleaning operations
- Modular design
  - Allows for easy maintenance and future upgrades
  - Adaptable to different water environments and cleaning requirements
